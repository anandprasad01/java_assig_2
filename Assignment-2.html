    Q1:-What are the differences between var, let and const?
    Ans:- Var :- (a) Function-scoped
                 (b) Hoisted and initialized to undefined
                 (c)Can be reassigned
                 (d)Can be redeclared
                 (e)Can be declared without an initial value

         let :- (a) Block-scoped
                (b) Hoisted but not initialized
                (c)Hoisted but not initialized
                (d) Cannot be redeclared in the same scope
                (e) Can be declared without an initial value

        const:- (a) Block-scoped
                (b) Hoisted but not initialized
                (c) Cannot be reassigned
                (d) Cannot be redeclared in the same scope
                (e) Must be initialized at the time of declaration

    Q2:- Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN
     Ans:- (a) Undefined:- It is a primitive value in JavaScript, indicating an uninitialized variable or accessing nonexistent properties. 
           (b) Not defined:- It refers to a referenceerror when attempting to use an undeclared variable. 
           (c) NaN:- denotes the result of invalid numeric operations, like dividing zero by zero or parsing non-numeric strings, representing     a special numeric value.

    Q3:- What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?
    Ans:- (a) NULL:- null signifies the blank value or an empty value. NULL can be used when you to assign 'unknown' or 'empty' value to a variable.
          (b) UNDEFINED:- undefined means a variable or property exists but hasn't been given a value. undefined can be used when a variable has been declared but not initialized or doesn't exist.


    Q4:-What is execution context ?
    Ans:- When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the Execution Context that handles the entire transformation and execution of the code. During the context runtime, the source code and allocates memory for the variables and functions. The source code is generated and gets executed.   
    
    Q5:- What is use of prompt in JavaScript?
    Ans:-  prompt in JavaScript creates a dialog box for user input. It's used to gather information interactively, enhancing user engagement.

    Q6:- Why JavaScript is Dyanmic Language?
    Ans:- JavaScript is dynamic due to features like dynamic typing, late binding, automatic memory management, and the ability to dynamically add or remove object properties, allowing flexibility and adaptability at runtime.
